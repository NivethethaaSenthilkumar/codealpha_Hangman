# Project Spotlight: Hangman Game in Python 🐍

I’m excited to share one of my recent projects – a classic Hangman game developed in Python! This was a fun and educational experience that allowed me to hone my programming skills and dive deeper into Python's capabilities.

# 🎮 About the Game
Hangman is a word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. The game provides feedback on which letters are correct and their positions in the word, as well as how many incorrect guesses are remaining.

# 💡 Features
Random Word Selection: The game selects a random word from a predefined list each time it starts.
User Input Validation: Ensures that players enter valid characters and handles invalid inputs gracefully.
Visual Representation: Displays the progress of the game visually with placeholders for unguessed letters and a visual representation of the hangman.
End Game Conditions: Clearly indicates whether the player has won or lost and reveals the correct word if the player loses.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
1.Python: The entire game logic and functionality were implemented using Python.
2.Loops and Conditional Statements: Used extensively to handle the game flow and logic.
3.Lists and String Manipulation: For storing the word, guessed letters, and displaying the game progress.
